> Cypress custom command "cy.api" for end-to-end API testing

This command makes HTTP requests to external servers, then renders the input and output where the web application usually is in the Cypress Test Runner. If there are server-side logs using [@bahmutov/all-logs][all-logs], this command fetches them and renders too. Here is typical output:

![`cy.api` in action](images/cy-api.png)

## Install

```
npm install --save-dev @maayehkhaled/cy-api
```

or

```
yarn add -D @maayehkhaled/cy-api
```

Add the following line to your Cypress support file

```js
// usually cypress/support/index.js
import '@maayehkhaled/cy-api'
```

This will add a new command `cy.api` for making API requests.

## Configuration

| var env                      | default value | description                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| CYPRESS_API_MESSAGES         | true          | Show and make call to api server logs |
| CYPRESS_API_SHOW_CREDENTIALS | false         | Show authentication password          |

By default `cy.api` print response in the browser. To have the same behaviour as `cy.request` and use `cy.visit` normally, you need to desactivate `apiDisplayRequest` :

```js
it('my test without displaying request', { apiDisplayRequest: false }, () => {
  cy.api({
    url: '/',
  })
})
```

## TypeScript

If your using TypeScript with Cypress, you can add type in your `tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["cypress", "@maayehkhaled/cy-api"]
  }
}
```
